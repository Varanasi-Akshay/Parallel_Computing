This repository will be regularly updated so you should 

1. Create an account on bitbucket, so that you can get
  notifications if the repository is updated.
  (There are good reasons for signing up with your utexas.edu
  email, rather gmail or such.)

And while you could

2. Visit the repository website and download the new files, or
3. regulary download the whole repository

it is probably better if

4. Install "hg" (also known as "mercurial") on your machine
5. and "clone" the repository:

hg clone https://bitbucket.org/VictorEijkhout/isp2017

(That actually doesn't require step 1.)

You can then update your clone by typing

hg update -u

in your local directory.

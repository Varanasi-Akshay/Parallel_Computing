<p>TeX processes its programs in an unusual multi-leveled way. In TeX parlance the different parts of the processor are given names of the stages of the digestive tract.</p><p>The first stage of processing, the "eyes" of TeX, converts a text to character code / category code pairs. The character codes will give us occasion to look at character encoding more in general. The category codes are what makes TeX impossible to parse in a traditional sense. We will look into the issue of parsing a bit more.</p><p>The next stage of TeX processing is the macro expansion level, also called the "mouth" of TeX. This part of the TeX language, surprisingly, lets you easily implement lambda calculus. We will have a look at lambda calculus (which is really a topic in foundations of mathematics or in theoretical computer science) and see how it can be realized in TeX. We will look at list processing as an example.</p>

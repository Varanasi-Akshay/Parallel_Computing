noweb-mode is an interactive Lisp function in `noweb-mode'.
(noweb-mode)

Minor meta mode for editing noweb files.
`Meta' refers to the fact that this minor mode is switching major
modes depending on the location of point.

The following special keystrokes are available in noweb mode:

Movement:
M-n C-n 	goto the next chunk
M-n C-p 	goto the previous chunk
M-n M-p 	goto the previous chunk of the same name
M-n M-n 	goto the next chunk of the same name
M-n g 	goto a chunk
M-n c 	goto the next code chunk
M-n C 	goto the previous code chunk
M-n d 	goto the next documentation chunk
M-n D 	goto the previous documentation chunk

Copying/Killing/Marking/Narrowing:
M-n w 	copy the chunk the point is in into the kill ring
M-n W 	copy the pair of doc/code chunks the point is in
M-n k 	kill the chunk the point is in
M-n K 	kill the pair of doc/code chunks the point is in
M-n m 	mark the chunk the point is in
M-n M 	mark the pair of doc/code chunks the point is in
M-n n 	narrow to the chunk the point is in
M-n N 	narrow to the pair of doc/code chunks the point is in
C-x n w 	widen
M-n t 	toggle auto narrowing

Filling:
M-n q 	fill the chunk at point according to mode.
M-q 	fill the paragraph at point, restricted to chunk.

Insertion:
M-n M-m 	insert a line to set this file's code mode
M-n i 	insert a new chunk at point
M-n TAB 	complete the chunk name before point.
@ 	insert a `@' or start a new doc chunk.
< 	insert a `<' or start a new code chunk.

Modes:
M-x noweb-set-doc-mode 	change the major mode for editing documentation chunks
M-x noweb-set-code-mode 	change the major mode for editing code chunks

Misc:
M-n o 	find all occurrences of the current chunk
M-n C-l 	update the markers for chunks
M-n C-h 	describe noweb-mode
M-n v 	show noweb-mode's version in the minibuffer

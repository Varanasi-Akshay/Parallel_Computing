Assume that at the end of the first line there will be two
breakpoints, one for a stretched and one for a shrunk line. At the end
of the second line there will be four possibilities, of which two
(stretch/shrink and shrink/stretch) are the same, giving three
breakpoints. Four feasible breakpoints at the end of the third line,
et cetera.

For short paragraphs this means that the cost will be roughly
quadratic in the number of lines of the paragraph.

After a number of lines, the breakpoints will merge: a certain breakpoint
will be feasible from $k$ stretched lines and from $k+1$ shrunk
ones. From that point on, every word introduces a feasible breakpoint,
so the cost is linear in the number of words to the end of the
paragraph and the number of words per line.

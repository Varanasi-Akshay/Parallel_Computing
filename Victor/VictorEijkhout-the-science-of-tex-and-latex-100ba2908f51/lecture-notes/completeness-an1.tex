If the decision problem can be solved, the optimization problem can be
solved by asking about various values of the bound. This means the
decision problem will be solved a logarithmic number of times.
This only works if the bound takes on integer values; for rational or
irrational values bisection search will not terminate.

A second assumption is that lower and upper bounds are given. This is
a reasonable assumption in many problems; for instance, in the
traveling salesman problem a linear time algorithm gives the sum of
all distances between cities, which is an upper bound. The lower bound
is zero.

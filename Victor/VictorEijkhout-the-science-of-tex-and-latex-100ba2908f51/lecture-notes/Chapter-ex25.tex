Write a \lex\ parser that analyzes text the way the \TeX\ input
processor does with the normal category code values. It should print
its output with
\begin{itemize}
\item \n{<space>} denoting any space that is not ignored or skipped, and
\item \n{<cs: command>} for recognizing a control sequence
  \cs{command};
\item open and close braces should also be marked
as~\verb+<{>+,~\verb+<}>+.
\end{itemize}
Here is some sample input:
\verbatiminput{texlexerinput}

Take a look at the headers and footers in Oetiker's `Not so short
introduction' and `\TeX\ by Topic' (the \LaTeX\ and \TeX\ part
of the handout). Can you find a reason to prefer one over the other
from a point of usability?
In both books, what is the rationale behind the header on the odd
pages? See in particular page~35 of the former and~77 of the
latter. Do you agree with this design?

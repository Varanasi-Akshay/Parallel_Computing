Recall that macro:
\verbatiminput{hangmacro.tex}
\begin{examplewithcode}
\input hangmacro
\begin{minipage}[t]{3in}
\def\biginitial#1{\hskip-20pt \Hang{\huge #1}\hskip 20pt}
\parindent=0pt

\everypar{\hangafter=-2 \hangindent=20pt \biginitial}
This is an old-fashioned mediaeval paragraph that has lots of text and
a very long first sentence. The second sentence is also long, and only

measure we throw in a third line which should make this four lines
long, if not five with a little luck.

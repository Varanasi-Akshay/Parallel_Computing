A forward approach is possible because the starting point is clear:
the zeroeth breakpoint is at the left margin of the first line. The
breakpoint at the beginning of the last line is not fixed in that
way. This means that we can not trivially solve the last stage.
A~forward approach to page breaking could use heuristics to flush the
memory to the output final every once in a while. A~backtracking
approach would have to store the whole document in memory before it
could start breaking.

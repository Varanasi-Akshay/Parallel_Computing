Write macros for homework typesetting; make one master document
  that will contain all your homework throughout this course.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define an environment \n{exercise} so that
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{exercise}
My answer is...
\end{exercise}
\end{verbatim}
gives
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Problem 5.} My answer is\dots
\end{quote}
The counter should be incremented automatically. List your solution in
your answer, and find a way that the listing is guaranteed to be the
code you actually use.
\item Write a macro \cs{Homework} that will go to a new page, and
  output
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Answers to the exercises for chapter 3}
\end{quote}
at the top of the page. The \n{exercise} environment should now take
the question as argument:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{exercise}{Here you paraphrase the question that was asked}
My answer is...
\end{exercise}
\end{verbatim}
and this outputs
\begin{quote}
\begin{exerciseB}{Here you paraphrase the question that was asked}
My answer is\dots
\end{exerciseB}
\end{quote}
(Hint: read the section on text boxes. Also be sure to use \cs{par} to
get \LaTeX\ to go to a new line.)
Allow for the question to be more than one line long. Unfortunately
you can not get verbatim text in the question. Find a way around that.
\end{enumerate}

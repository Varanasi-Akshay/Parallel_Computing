\project \TeX\ has a syntax that can to a large extent be altered, 
dynamically or statically. This has had the effect that macro packages
typically use a syntax that is somewhere between ad hoc and plain
unsystematic. Explore how it would be possible to set up a macro
package with object-oriented syntax and design. It would probably be a
good idea to read~\cite{E3,E4,EL}, and to look at macro package such
as Lollipop and ConTeXt.

\project The web site \url{http://wwww.cookingforengineers.com} uses a
table-like layout for notating recipes. Design an easy syntax for
inputting these diagrams, and write a \LaTeX\ package that implements
them.

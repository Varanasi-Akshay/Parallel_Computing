Given two transitions one an input symbol, replace that by a single
transition to a new state, and $\epsilon$-transitions to the original
two destination states.

If an NFA has an $\epsilon$-transition from state~1 to state~2, we can
replace that by a jump from state~0 to state~2, triggered by the
symbol that made the transition from~0 to~1.

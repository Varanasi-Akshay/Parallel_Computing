Finish this argument. Show that, if we can solve the optimization
problem, we can solve the decision problem.
Now, supposing we can solve the decision problem, how
does that give a solution of the optimization problem? Assume that the
outcome of the optimization problem is an integer quantity. Do you
have to make other assumptions; discuss? What is
the complexity of the one solution method given a certain complexity
for the other?

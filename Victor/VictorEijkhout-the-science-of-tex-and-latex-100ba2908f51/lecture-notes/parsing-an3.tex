Given a mapping $I\times S\rightarrow O$, and denote
$o_{i,s}$~the output symbol for input~$i$ and state~$s$.
For each state~$s$,
introduce a new state~$s_i$ for any input symbol that has a defined
transition out of~$s$. Let that state output the
symbol~$o_{i,s}$. Now define an $\epsilon$-transition
from~$s_i$ to the state that was the original transition from~$s$
under~$i$. Give that state no output.

The reverse equivalence is trivial: if a state maps to an output, then
it maps to that output with every input. Formally, if
$s\mapsto o$ in the second definition, then
$\{i,s\}\mapsto o$ for all~$i$ in the first.

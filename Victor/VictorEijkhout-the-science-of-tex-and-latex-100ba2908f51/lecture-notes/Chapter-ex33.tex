Not every word should be added to the active list. For instance, for
any realistic line length, the second word in the paragraph will not
have a valid breakpoint after it, so we need not consider it.  Take
the model implementation and add this modification. Measure the
improvement in running time, for instance by counting the number of
calls to some inner routine.  Give a theoretical argument for how this
reduces the complexity of the algorithm.

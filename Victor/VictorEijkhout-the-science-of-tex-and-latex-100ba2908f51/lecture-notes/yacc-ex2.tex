Use the \TeX\ parser you wrote in \lex\ to parse
\LaTeX\ documents. The parser should
\begin{itemize}
\item Report the documentclass used;
\item Check that \verb+\begin{document}+ and \verb+\end{document}+ are
  used, with no text before the begin command;
\item Know about some commands with one argument, such as~\cs{textbf},
  and properly recognize that argument
\item Recognize proper matching of begin/end of an environment.
\end{itemize}
Bonus: let your parser interpret \cs{newcommand} correctly. You can
limit yourself to the the case of commands with one argument, that is
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\foo}[1]{ ...}
\end{verbatim}

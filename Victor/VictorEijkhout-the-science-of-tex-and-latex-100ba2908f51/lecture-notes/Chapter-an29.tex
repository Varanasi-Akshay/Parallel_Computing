In a list that is sorted, you do not have to search to the end. Your
average search time will be halved if the search is unsuccessful. If
the search is successful there will be no difference.

In languages with a block structure, data needs to be removed from the
list at the end of a block. It is then a better idea to organize data
by block level, with the innermost block at the front of the list. If
the blocklevel is included in the key (as most significant part), the
list will be organized this way by keeping it sorted.

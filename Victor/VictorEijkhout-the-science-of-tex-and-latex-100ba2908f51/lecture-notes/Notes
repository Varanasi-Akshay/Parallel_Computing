Parsing:
inhernet ambiguity
The standard example of a language with inherent ambiguity is  L = L1 U L2, where  L1 = {a^m b^m c^n | m,n>0}  L2 = {a^m b^n c^n | m,n>0}This is clearly context free, e.g. by the grammar  S -> S1 | S2  S1 -> A1 C  S2 -> A B1  A1 -> a b | a A1 b  B1 -> b c | b B1 c  C -> c | c C  A -> a | a C
any string in the intersection will have two different parse trees

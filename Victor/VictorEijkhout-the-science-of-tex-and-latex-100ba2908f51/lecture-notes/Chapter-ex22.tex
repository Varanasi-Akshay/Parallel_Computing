Write an integer postfix calculator in \lex: expression such as
\verb/1 2 +/ and \verb.1 2 3 4/*-. should be evaluated to \n{3}
and~\n{-.5} respectively. White space only serves to separate number,
but is otherwise optional; the line end denotes the end of an
expression. You will probably need the \n{C} function \n{int
  atoi(char*)} which converts strings to ints.

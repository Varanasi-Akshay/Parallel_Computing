0. NOTE

This is a development repository. There is NO GUARANTEE that
anything here is useful, will not change, or will compile and run
to begin with.

1. Reading material

The reports directory contains a couple of technical reports
describing the ideas of the IMP model

2. Code

Code in the `code' directory relies on a couple of external packages.

- For unittests you need to download the file catch.hpp
  from https://github.com/philsquared/Catch

- in the Make.inc file you need to indicate the location
  of cppformat. Download from http://cppformat.github.io/

You need to indicate the location of these in imp/Make.inc
There is an example file to base yourself off.

The code uses many C++11 and C++14 features.

3. Running

In the subdirectories mpi,omp,product the command "make regression"
should pass. NOTE not guaranteed in the development version.

In mpi/mpi_apps et cetera, type "make" to see which applications
can be build and run.
